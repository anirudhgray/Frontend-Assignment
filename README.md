# Frontend-Assignment

NOTE: I have added sample json inputs for the app in [/sample-inputs](/sample-inputs). This is slightly different from the given sample input from the problem statement document since I have added a field for the form title. It is as follow:

```json
{
    "title": "Pizza Maker",
    "fields": [
        {...},
        {...},
        ...fieldsAsProvided
    ]
}
```

You can check out a **[live demo here](https://frontend-assignment-kohl.vercel.app/)**

### How to run locally
```bash
gh repo clone anirudhgray/Frontend-Assignment
cd Frontend-Assignment
npm i
npm start
```
